# V1 Payment

A payment represents a paid transaction between a Square merchant and a
customer. Payment details are usually available from Connect API endpoints
within a few minutes after the transaction completes.

Each Payment object includes several fields that end in `_money`. These fields
describe the various amounts of money that contribute to the payment total:

<ul>
<li>
Monetary values are <b>positive</b> if they represent an
<em>increase</em> in the amount of money the merchant receives (e.g.,
<code>tax_money</code>, <code>tip_money</code>).
</li>
<li>
Monetary values are <b>negative</b> if they represent an
<em>decrease</em> in the amount of money the merchant receives (e.g.,
<code>discount_money</code>, <code>refunded_money</code>).
</li>
</ul>
